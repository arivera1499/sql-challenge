# sql-challenge

-During this challenge most of the material referenced came from rewatching lectures as well as assistance during office hours. I also missed a day of lecture of class so i had to heavily reference outside material when extra explinations where needed. 

-chatGPT was used when further explinations or quick definitions where needed for a lot of the general syntax of sql. I did run into some trouble when trying to upload the csv files into the tables that where creted but the ta's where able to explain the issue that was going on and helped resolve it.
